Implementing A REST API with CRUD operations.
Using Drupals' REST API.
Use of the @RestResource Plugin.
Module provides a rest API with CRUD operations on a custom entity named products.
Also we periodically consume a public API "http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/newspapers.json"
checking the "Last-Modified" headers and refresh and store our data locally on award entity.
Lastly we provide another rest endopoint with only GET method with the data consumed.
