My dear friend paris! i try to build a custom REST Server API. I  provide rest endpoints for the product entity.
I have build the ProductRestResource plugin that should do all the job. I would like to notice that the custom config doesnt work (rest.resourse.product_rest_api.yml). If i enable the Rest from the build in REST UI of drupal (admin/config/services/rest) it works. Well as you can see in my plugin i provide the logic only for the get and post. Of course only the Get works and thats because i am a noob. I do all my tests with Google Postman. Help if you wish or else write me in your @@. Thanks in advance. Peace, love Unity!
